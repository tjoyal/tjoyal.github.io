# About

I’m a product engineer primarily working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

I’m a forgetful human who likes to take notes so I can replay what I did whenever I need to do the exact same thing.

I’ll be using this blog to experiment around how to share some of these notes and the tooling surrounding said process.
